======
After cloning down the repository, in the root directory run:

```sh
$ node setup
```
Then, in the newly created `.env` directory copy and paste these values inside of the empty quotes:
```sh
mongodb://localhost/cfgram
letTheRightOneIn
```
Now you'll have the necessary environment variables needed for authentication.
